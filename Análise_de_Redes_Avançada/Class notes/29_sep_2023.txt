Main notes:
  - If we have a targeted network we can only use half of the matrix 
  - If we have a non targeted network we need to use all the matrix 
  - With normalization we reduce the dependency relation between two variables
  - Central quantities to keep in mind in network science:
    * Degree Distribution
    * Midian Distance 
    * Clustering Coefficient 
  

Todo:
  - Final project is to be done till 22th December
    * Presentation will be in classes
